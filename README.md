# GroqCasters

**This fork of GroqCasters extends the original project with the following:**
- Integration with F5-TTS for advanced voice cloning capabilities.
- An abstraction layer allowing users to switch between Bark and F5-TTS for voice generation.
- Important note: The F5-TTS project is undergoing significant updates and refactors, and this version may not be fully interoperable with future F5-TTS releases.
  - [ ] TODO: Revisit F5-TTS progress and merge updates when the project stabilizes.

GroqCasters is a Python application that generates podcast scripts and corresponding audio using AI technologies. It leverages PocketGroq for script generation and Bark for text-to-speech conversion, allowing for custom voice cloning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/groqcasters.git
   cd groqcasters
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your GROQ API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   On Windows, use `set GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage

GroqCasters can be used in two modes:

1. Generate a new script and audio:
   ```bash
   python groqcasters.py path/to/input_text.txt path/to/output_directory
   ```

2. Use a pre-written script:
   ```bash
   python groqcasters.py path/to/script.txt path/to/output_directory --use-script
   ```

The generated audio will be saved as `full_podcast.wav` in the specified output directory.

## Configuration

Create a `config.py` file in the project directory with the following content:

```python
DEFAULT_MODEL = "your_default_model_name"
MAX_TOKENS = {
    "outline": 8000,
    "full_script": 8000,
    "dialogue": 8000
}
HOST_PROFILES = """
Host1 (Rachel): Enthusiastic, prone to personal anecdotes.
Host2 (Mike): More analytical, enjoys making pop culture references.
"""
OUTLINE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = "Your outline prompt template here"
EXPAND_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = "Your expand prompt template here"
DIALOGUE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = "Your dialogue prompt template here"
```

Adjust these values according to your needs.

## Custom Voice Samples

To use custom voice samples:

1. Prepare a short (15-30 second) clear audio clip of the desired voice.
2. Save the audio as a WAV file.
3. Update the `CUSTOM_MALE_VOICE_PATH` and `CUSTOM_FEMALE_VOICE_PATH` variables in `groqcasters.py` with the paths to your custom voice files.

## Operational Parameters

- `SUNO_USE_SMALL_MODELS`: Set to "True" to use smaller Bark models (default: True)
- `SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU`: Set to "True" to offload processing to CPU if GPU is unavailable (default: False)
- `MALE_VOICE_PRESET`: Default male voice preset for Bark (default: "v2/en_speaker_6")
- `FEMALE_VOICE_PRESET`: Default female voice preset for Bark (default: "v2/en_speaker_9")

These can be adjusted in the `groqcasters.py` file.

## Dependencies

See the `requirements.txt` file for a full list of dependencies. Key dependencies include:

- pocketgroq
- bark
- torch
- numpy
- scipy

## Extending GroqCasters for Multiple Characters

GroqCasters is initially designed for two characters, but you can extend it to support more. Here's a guide on how to modify the application for multiple characters:

1. Update the `config.py` file:
   - Extend the `HOST_PROFILES` to include additional characters:
     ```python
     HOST_PROFILES = """
     Host1 (Rachel): Enthusiastic, prone to personal anecdotes.
     Host2 (Mike): More analytical, enjoys making pop culture references.
     Host3 (Alex): Tech-savvy, often explains complex concepts.
     Host4 (Sarah): Creative, brings in artistic perspectives.
     """
     ```

2. Modify the `groqcasters.py` file:
   - Add voice presets for new characters:
     ```python
     VOICE_PRESETS = {
         "rachel": "v2/en_speaker_9",
         "mike": "v2/en_speaker_6",
         "alex": "v2/en_speaker_2",
         "sarah": "v2/en_speaker_4"
     }
     ```
   - Update the `_create_voice_prompt` method to handle multiple custom voices:
     ```python
     def __init__(self):
         # ... existing code ...
         self.custom_voices = {
             "rachel": self._create_voice_prompt("path/to/rachel_voice.wav"),
             "mike": self._create_voice_prompt("path/to/mike_voice.wav"),
             "alex": self._create_voice_prompt("path/to/alex_voice.wav"),
             "sarah": self._create_voice_prompt("path/to/sarah_voice.wav")
         }
     ```

   - Modify the `generate_audio_from_script` method to use the new voice selection:
     ```python
     def generate_audio_from_script(self, script, output_dir):
         lines = script.split('\n')
         audio_segments = []
         
         for line in lines:
             if line.strip():
                 speaker, text = line.split(':', 1)
                 speaker = speaker.strip().lower()
                 text = text.strip()
                 
                 voice = self.custom_voices.get(speaker) or VOICE_PRESETS.get(speaker, VOICE_PRESETS["rachel"])
                 
                 try:
                     # ... existing audio generation code ...
                 except Exception as e:
                     print(f"Error generating audio for line: {line}")
                     print(f"Error details: {e}")
         
         # ... rest of the method remains the same ...
     ```

3. Update the script generation prompts:
   - Modify the `OUTLINE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, `EXPAND_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, and `DIALOGUE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `config.py` to include instructions for handling multiple characters.

4. Adjust the script parsing:
   - If your input scripts have a specific format for multiple speakers, update the script parsing logic in `generate_audio_from_script` to handle this format correctly.

5. Test thoroughly:
   - Create test scripts with multiple characters to ensure the system handles them correctly.
   - Generate audio for these test scripts and verify that each character has the correct voice.
